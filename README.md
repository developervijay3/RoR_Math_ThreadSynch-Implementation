Optimized Math
================================================================================================================================================
Prints all positive integers from 1 to 100. If the number is divisible by both two and three, instead of saying that the number is odd,
even or divisible by three; state that the number is 'divisible by two and three'.

Sample Output
---------------
The number '1' is odd.
The number '2' is even.
The number '3' is divisible by three.
...
The number '6' is divisible by two and three.

Run Logic
-------------
Used Bitwise & operator to check the number divisibility for faster operation
Usage
------------
ruby OptimizedMath.rb

Thread Synchronization
==================================================================================================================================================
Prints all positive integers from 1 to 100. One thread prints odd and second thread prints even

Sample Output
---------------
Thread 1: The number is ‘1’
Thread 2: The number is ‘2’
Thread 1: The number is ‘3’

Installation
------------
require threads - 

Usage
--------------
ruby ThreadSynchronization.rb
